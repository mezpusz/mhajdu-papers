This paper aims to contribute to the automation of proving problems with inductive types in the area of saturation-based theorem proving. Specifically, it introduces (1) new techniques to generate induction formulas and (2) new inference rules in saturation-based proof search to tackle some of the issues inherent in this topic.

While induction itself has been a well-known mathematical tool for centuries, its automation in inductive proofs started only in the 70s with a sequence of theorem provers like ACL2, CLAM/OYSTER or IsaPlanner just to name a few. In the nowadays more and more prominent field of saturation-based theorem proving, induction has been relatively out of focus with some work done in e.g. ZipperPosition, Vampire or CVC4. These initial inductive techniques mostly utilize basic induction formulas for term algebra datatypes and integers and during saturation very little help is provided for the prover to be able to actually solve the problems. We address several of these issues in this paper.
