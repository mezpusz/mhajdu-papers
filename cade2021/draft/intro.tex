This paper aims to contribute to the automation of proving problems with inductive types in the area of saturation-based theorem proving. Specifically, it introduces (1) new techniques to generate induction formulas and (2) new inference rules in saturation-based proof search to tackle some of the issues inherent in this topic.

Automation in inductive proofs started in the 70s with a sequence of theorem provers like \textsc{ACL2} \cite{aclhandbook}, \textsc{CLAM/OYSTER} \cite{oyster} or \textsc{IsaPlanner} \cite{isabelle} just to name a few. In the nowadays more and more prominent field of saturation-based theorem proving, induction has been relatively out of focus with some work done in e.g. \textsc{ZipperPosition} \cite{cruanes}, \textsc{Vampire} \cite{vampireinduction,vampiregeneralization} or \textsc{CVC4} \cite{cvc4,smtinduction}. These initial inductive techniques mostly utilize basic induction formulas for term algebra datatypes/integers and very little help is provided to the prover during saturation in order to actually solve the problems. We address several of these issues in this paper.
