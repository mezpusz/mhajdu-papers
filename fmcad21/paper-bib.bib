abstract = {A theorem proving system has been programmed for automating mildly complex proofs by structural induction. One purpose was to prove properties of simple functional programs without loops or assignments. One can see the formal system as a generalization of number theory: the formal language is typed and the induction rule is valid for all types. Proofs are generated by working backward from the goal. The induction strategy splits into two parts: (1) the selection of induction variables, which is claimed to be linked to the useful generalization of terms to variables, and (2) the generation of induction subgoals, in particular, the selection and specialization of hypotheses. Other strategies include a fast simplification algorithm. The prover can cope with situations as complex as the definition and correctness proof of a simple compiling algorithm for expressions.},

A joint project of NYU and U Iowa, CVC4 aims to support the useful feature set of CVC3 and SMT-LIBv2 while optimizing the design of the core system architecture and decision procedures to take advantage of recent engineering and algorithmic advances. CVC4 represents a completely new code base; it is a from-scratch rewrite of CVC3, and many subsystems have been completely redesigned. Additional decision procedures for CVC4 are currently under development, but for what it currently achieves, it is a lighter-weight and higher-performing tool than CVC3. We describe the system architecture, subsystems of note, and discuss some applications and continuing work.",

    abstract = "{We present various refutationally complete calculi for first-order clauses with equality that allow for arbitrary selection of negative atoms in clauses. Refutational completeness is established via the use of well-founded orderings on clauses for defining a Herbrand model for a consistent set of clauses. We also formulate an abstract notion of redundancy and show that the deletion of redundant clauses during the theorem proving process preserves refutational completeness. It is often possible to compute the closure of non-trivial sets of clauses under application of non-redundant inferences. The refutation of goals for such complete sets of clauses is simpler than for arbitrary sets of clauses, in particular it suffices to consider only those proofs that have support from the goals, without compromising refutational completeness. For certain classes of formulas the search space can be restricted even further, as we demonstrate for so-called quasi-Horn clauses. The results in this paper contain as special cases or generalize many known results about Knuth–Bendix-like completion procedures (for equations, Horn clauses, and Horn clauses with Boolean conditions), completion of first-order clauses by clausal rewriting, and inductive theorem proving for Horn clauses.}",

	abstract="Satisfiability modulo theory solvers are increasingly being used to solve quantified formulas over structures such as integers and term algebras. Quantifier instantiation combined with ground decision procedure alone is insufficient to prove many formulas of interest in such cases. We present a set of techniques that introduce inductive reasoning into SMT solving algorithms that is sound with respect to the interpretation of structures in SMT-LIB standard. The techniques include inductive strengthening of conjecture to be proven, as well as facility to automatically discover subgoals during an inductive proof, where subgoals themselves can be proven using induction. The techniques have been implemented in CVC4. Our experiments show that the developed techniques have good performance and coverage of a range of inductive reasoning problems. Our experiments also show the impact of different representations of natural numbers and quantifier instantiation techniques on the performance of inductive reasoning. Our solution is freely available in the CVC4 development repository. In addition its overall effectiveness, it has an advantage of accepting SMT-LIB input and being integrated with other SMT solving techniques of CVC4.",
